# Cross-Platform-Traceability
This Project provides an IntelliJ Plugin that integrates J2Swift into the IntelliJ IDEA / Android Studio IDE.
Except from the swift output, a traceability model is created, that lets users navigate directly to swift resources.
If you install the Refactorator App(https://github.com/johnno1962/RefactoratorApp) on OSX, there is also an action that lets you rename variables in Java and corresponding Swift files.
